***DAY 3*** (Apr 18, 2016)
-

* Packet sniffing using 'Wireshark' and extracting I-ON passwords.
* Don't use ``std::endl`` in C++. It means ``"\n" << std::flush`` which is unoptimized. Use ``'\n'`` instead.

* Hash is the purest form of weed.
* Use ``'\n'`` instead of ``"\n"``. In later it looks for a null character at the end (as in string) whereas in the former compiler looks at it as a character.
