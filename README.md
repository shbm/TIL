***DAY 2*** (Apr 17, 2016)

* Figured out I-ON auto-login.

```shell
# bash commands 
USER_NAME="j_xxxxxxxxx"
PASSWORD="mypassword"
curl "http://172.31.31.1/24online/servlet/E24onlineHTTPClient" --data "mode=191&isAccessDenied=false&url=null&message=&checkClose=1&sessionTimeout=-1&guestmsgreq=false&logintype=2&orgSessionTimeout=-1&chrome=-1&alerttime=null&timeout=-1&popupalert=0&dtold=0&mac=ec%3A30%3A91%3Aa2%3A84%3Ac7&servername=172.31.31.1&username=$USER_NAME&password=$PASSWORD&loginotp=false&logincaptcha=false&registeruserotp=false&registercaptcha=false"
```

* Big Integers in JAVA and GO use array for simulating multiplication, division, addition, subtraction etc. for calculation similar to what is taught in primary schools.

***DAY 3*** (Apr 18, 2016)
-

* Packet sniffing using 'Wireshark' and extracting I-ON passwords.

* Don't use ``std::endl`` in C++. It means ``"\n" << std::flush`` which is unoptimized. Use ``'\n'`` instead.

* Hash is the purest form of weed.

* Use ``'\n'`` instead of ``"\n"``. In later it looks for a null character at the end (as in string) whereas in the former compiler looks at it as a character.
